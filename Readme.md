# Usage
Set up the pico-sdk as described in the Getting Started guide and set the PICO_SDK_PATH environment variable. Then run `zig build`. A `firmware.uf2` should appear in the zig-out.

The current configuration is for the Pico W and this is basically the Pico W blink example. You can set -DPICO_BOARD at the top of build.zig.

# Notes

Replace `config/config_autogen.h` and `config/version.h` with the autogenerated headers from the build/generated/ directory after your first `zig-build`. It seems to work without it, but those headers are supposed to be meaningful.
