# Usage
Set up the pico-sdk as described in the Getting Started guide and set the PICO_SDK_PATH environment variable. Then run `zig build`. A `firmware.uf2` should appear in the zig-out.

The current configuration is for the Pico W and this is basically the Pico W blink example. You can set -DPICO_BOARD at the top of build.zig.

# Notes

Replace `config/pico/config_autogen.h` and `config/pico/version.h` with the autogenerated headers from the build/generated/ directory after your first `zig-build`. You will probably need a `config_autogen.h` from the build folder of one of the pico-examples (e.g. blink) or to fill in the .example file in `config/pico` by hand and rename it.
